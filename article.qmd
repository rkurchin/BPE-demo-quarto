# Introduction
If you needed to estimate parameters – that is to say, fit a model – the first mathematical tool you would likely reach for would be linear regression. In this article, we'll explore an alternative to linear regression called Bayesian Parameter Estimation and consider in what circumstances it might be preferable. 

# Background: Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is a simple statement about conditional probabilities:

$$
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
$$ {#eq-bayes}

In this notation, $H$ is a hypothesis and $E$ is some evidence we have observed. So Bayes' theorem tells us that we can compute the probability of some hypothesis being true given that we have observed a piece of evidence if we know:
* the probability of observing said evidence in a world where the hypothesis is true, 
* the probability of our hypothesis being true, and
* the probability of observing the evidence.

It can be "derived" by considering that we can get the area of region AB below both by considering it either as the fraction of A that AB occupies multiplied by the total area of A *or* as the fraction of B that AB occupies multiplied by the total area of B. (The "Universe" is included to remind us that for A and B to represent probabilities, they have to be normalized!). For a more detailed version of this explanation, check out Oscar Bonilla's [blog post on "Visualizing Bayes' Theorem](https://oscarbonilla.com/2009/05/visualizing-bayes-theorem/).

### Eruption History

A number of eruptions were recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s, these are summarised in @tbl-history.

| Name      | Year |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Current      | 2021       |
| Teneguía   | 1971        |
| Nambroque   | 1949        |
| El Charco   | 1712        |
| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677        |
| Volcán San Martin   | 1646        |
| Tajuya near El Paso   | 1585        |
| Montaña Quemada   | 1492        |

: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}

This equates to an eruption on average every 79 years up until the 1971 event. The probability of a future eruption can be modeled by a Poisson distribution @eq-poisson.

$$
p(x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}


Where $\lambda$ is the number of eruptions per year, $\lambda=\frac{1}{79}$ in this case. The probability of a future eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated by:

$$
p_e = 1-\mathrm{e}^{-t \lambda}
$$ {#eq-probability}

So following the 1971 eruption the probability of an eruption in the following 50 years — the period ending this year — was 0.469. After the event, the number of eruptions per year moves to $\lambda=\frac{1}{75}$ and the probability of a further eruption within the next 50 years (2022-2071) rises to 0.487 and in the next 100 years, this rises again to 0.736.
